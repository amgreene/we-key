# we-key
This is a project to set up a highly interlinked wiki-like web site for genealogy.

Each person, each document, each location, etc. has its own page.

By tagging each of those things, appropriate cross-links can be automatically generated.

By being careful with markup and metadata, lots of useful reports can ge generated as well.

The data are all stored in plain text files and content is intended to be edited with Emacs, not online.
