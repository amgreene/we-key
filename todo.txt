STILL TO DO
# Formalize virtualenv bootstrap
# Use config file to locate data directory instead of hardcoded path
# Head shot/primary image
# Make xref display sensitive to the type of xref document
# Validate @names
# "Header" stuff on the side, not the top
# Complete life chronology
# Better font choices in css
# search (regex)
# cross-link addresses
# Proxy images correctly
# Fix link scope when expanding name to include "child of"
# Add support for internal TOC
# Need to allow for escaped @?
# How to handle structured info better (e.g. marriage) by using indentation
# add "last modified" timestamp to bottom of page
# "list of all people/documents" (sortable by name, location, modified stamp, birth date, record date, etc.)
# support for confidence levels
# auto-index when timestamps require it (or make it easier to do automatically)
# display family tree
# display list of children (computed)
# If it's a @FooBar, then when pretty-printing it insert spaces
# jquery?
# make Page act more databasey (linking to others, etc.)
# support for external URLs
# Page object should lazyload 
# text is just another info member, but implicit?

# Types of pages: 
# - Documents (B_ M_ D_ N_ T_ C_ A_ P_ X_ birth/marriage/death/natl/travel (eg passenger list)/census/article/photo/other)
# - People
# - Research dossiers 
# - Places (cities, addresses, etc.?)
# - Articles
