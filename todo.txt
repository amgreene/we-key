TO DO
======================================================================

INFRASTRUCTURE

# auto-index when timestamps require it
# Formalize virtualenv bootstrap
# Switch to use Twitter Bootstrap

ARCHITECTURE

# Page object should lazyload
# make Page act more databasey (linking to others, etc.)
# Make cleaner distinction between AtPath instances and Page instances

ACTUAL DATA

# Add Birth (done), Death, Marriage, Travel, Naturalization, etc. images to index
# Export images from Ancestry (census, passenger lists, etc.)
# Start converting people data
# Start converting/writing essays

IMAGES

# Consolidate referenced images
# Convert TIFFs (since the browsers don't like them)
# Push that subset to website

DATA AND METADATA

# parse text into a structured tree AT LOAD TIME, with {} designating atoms etc., and then render *that*
# be more formal about end of info block
# Correct formatting of quas.
# support for confidence levels
# support for external URLs
# Need to allow for escaped @?
# tag \source for data
# within a document, be able to mark blocks as being \about @people
# schema to validate info tags
# Implicit identification of family name vs given name?
# \[citation] within data, to be turned into HTML decorations
# Clean up all places where I'm currently forcing info to have a single value by using [0] to get only the first
# Allow in-file pagination (a la Onchan Letters)
# Allow in-file sub-pages (rather than one file = one @ link)

DATA VALIDATION

# Validate @paths
# Check that marriages are symmetrical
# Check that children are born a reasonable time after their parents

AUTO-GENERATED CONTENT SUMMARY

# Generalize ancestors minitree so it doesn't assume at most one each of father, mother
# Ancestors could display one more generation by using parens and commas immediately after each grgrp's name
# Display compact list of descendants under the ancestors list
# Complete life chronology

APPEARANCE

# Better font choices in css
# "Header" stuff on the side, not the top
# Head shot/primary image/gallery
# Make display of auto-indexed xref links sensitive to the type of xref document
# jquery?
# Smallcaps for last names?
# Tablet-friendly
# Adjust y offset of dotted underline for links

NAVIGATION

# Auto-update image index with not-yet-indexed files from specific directories
# Search site (using regex)
# Add support for internal TOC within text
# Make master index sortable/filterable by name, location, modified stamp, birth date, record date, etc.
# Auto-link dates into chronology
# Index should display additional (distinguishing) features (birth date, parents, etc.)
# Use of #hashtags?

PREP FOR PUBLIC SHARING

# Privacy controls
# Access controls
# Where to store images?
# How to control uploading of updates? 
# Opportunities for feedback?

NARRATIVE FLOW

# Make it possible to layer a guided narrative flow on top of these pages
# Make that exportable

----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Types of pages: 
# - Documents (B_ M_ D_ N_ T_ C_ A_ P_ X_ birth/marriage/death/natl/travel (eg passenger list)/census/article/photo/other)
# - People
# - Research dossiers 
# - Places (cities, addresses, etc.?)
# - Articles

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Sprint 5 -- 2015-05-29 and ongoing

# STARTED Redo everything to use Twitter Bootstrap
# STARTED Clean up code to conform to pep8
# STARTED Floating images (autogenerate small versions)
# DONE A few quick HTML nicities for & and ' and " and -- 
# DONE Use config file to locate data directory instead of hardcoded path
# DONE Support arbitrary URLs (for external links)
# DONE \i for italics
# DONE increase font size
# DONE dotted underlines for links in the main text
# DONE use SHA hashes to refer to images (since I keep renaming/rearranging them)
# DONE Stop calling these .html files; they aren't. (Changed to .wk)
# DONE Generate smaller versions of images that we're using in a web_stage directory


[Long break between sprints 4 and 5]

Sprint 4 -- 2015-02-16

# DONE Make index pages look nicer
# DONE Make index pages easier to get to
# DONE Indicate (in the index) which links are stubs that need populating
# DONE Some wiki-like markup -- * for bullet list, .heading for h2
# DONE Parse text into tree and format that -- first pass at such a refactoring
# DONE Display original image next to transcribed form

Sprint 3 -- 2015-02-16

# DONE Serve up images (simply for now)
# DONE Get rid of __getattr__ which was creating more compliations than it was solving
# DONE Refactor so Info is a class (which will allow for recursion, but this item is just the refactoring with no new behavior)
# DONE Info should be able to get/set using hierarchical keys, but without breaking existing callers (who expect a list of strings when doing a simple GET)
# DONE Handle structured info (e.g. marriage) by using indentation

Sprint 2 -- 2015-02-05

# DONE If it's a @FooBar, then when pretty-printing it insert spaces
# DONE add "last modified" timestamp to bottom of page
# DONE make reindexing easier to get to
# DONE The indexes should be JSON
# DONE Generate a relationship index alongside the general-purpose xref index
# DONE display list of children (computed) (proof of data flow)
# DONE cache page objects once loaded
# DONE display compact list of ancestors in upper right

Sprint 1 -- 2015-02-04

# DONE Put this in git
# DONE Compute reverse index 
# DONE Display xrefs from reverse index
# DONE format.py is the wrong name for that file
# DONE Nicer formatting of transcribed forms
# DONE add Unicode support; Hebrew Name as a person property
# DONE add default text for pages that don't have any
# DONE Page object should and use generalized __getattr__ to access members of info
# DONE info should be a defaultdict(list)
